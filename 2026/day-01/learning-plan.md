## What I Think About DevOps and Cloud

To me, DevOps is all about **working smarter, not harder**. It’s about connecting development and operations so apps can be built, deployed, and maintained reliably. Automation, collaboration, and continuous improvement are the key parts.  

Cloud Engineering is using platforms like **AWS** to host and scale applications without worrying about physical servers.  

I see a **DevOps Engineer** as someone who not only builds and deploys systems but also keeps them running smoothly, fixes issues quickly, and makes life easier for everyone on the team.

##  Why I Want to Learn DevOps and Cloud

I want to learn DevOps because I don’t just want to write code—I want to **see it run in real-world systems**.  

With my **AI/ML background**, I want to be able to deploy models and applications that actually work in production, are reliable, and are secure.  

I also know DevOps skills open doors to roles like:  
- DevOps Engineer  
- Cloud Engineer  
- MLOps Engineer  
- SRE (Site Reliability Engineer)  

Ultimately, I want a career where I can **build, automate, troubleshoot, and take full ownership** of systems.

## 🏁 My Goals for the Next 90 Days

By the end of 90 days, I hope to be able to:

- Deploy a **real-world style application** on AWS using Docker, Kubernetes, and Argo CD.  
- Build **CI/CD pipelines** that automate building, testing, and deploying apps.  
- Monitor systems, read logs, and fix problems like a proper DevOps Engineer.  
- Get a basic understanding of **MLOps**—how to deploy and monitor ML models in production.

## ⏱ My Study Plan

**Weekly Time Commitment:**  
- Weekdays: 2–2.5 hours/day  
- Weekends: 4–6 hours/day

## 🧠 My Mindset

I know learning won’t always be smooth. Mistakes will happen—and that’s okay, because that’s part of DevOps.  

The important thing is **staying consistent** and improving every day.  
I’m treating these 90 days like a real job, and I’m fully responsible for my own growth.
